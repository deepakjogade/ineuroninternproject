The device launches
your app and creates
an activity object.

The activity object
specifies a layout.

The activity tells
Android to display the
layout onscreen.

The user interacts
with the layout that's
displayed on the device.

The activity responds
to these interactions by
running application code.

The activity updates
the display...

...which the user sees

on the device.
